# Authentication Test Guide

## Test the Profile Page Redirect Fix

### Test Case 1: Profile Page Reload
1. **Sign in** to your account
2. **Navigate to** `/profile` page
3. **Reload the page** (Ctrl+R or F5)
4. **Expected Result**: Should stay on profile page, NOT redirect to dashboard
5. **Check Console**: Look for these messages:
   - `AuthContext: Getting initial session...`
   - `AuthContext: Initial session loaded`
   - `AuthContext: Checking redirects`
   - `AuthContext: No redirect needed - user is on correct page`

### Test Case 2: Auth Page Access (Authenticated User)
1. **Sign in** to your account
2. **Navigate to** `/auth` page
3. **Expected Result**: Should redirect to dashboard smoothly without flashing
4. **Check Console**: Look for:
   - `AuthContext: Redirecting authenticated user from /auth to /dashboard`

### Test Case 3: Protected Page Access (Unauthenticated User)
1. **Sign out** of your account
2. **Navigate to** `/dashboard` or `/profile`
3. **Expected Result**: Should redirect to auth page
4. **Check Console**: Look for:
   - `AuthContext: Redirecting unauthenticated user to /auth`

### Test Case 4: Real Sign In
1. **Sign out** of your account
2. **Sign in** with your credentials
3. **Expected Result**: Should redirect to dashboard
4. **Check Console**: Look for:
   - `AuthContext: Real sign in detected, redirecting to dashboard`

## Console Messages to Look For

### ✅ Good Messages (No Redirect Issues):
```
AuthContext: Getting initial session...
AuthContext: Initial session loaded {hasUser: true, userEmail: '...'}
AuthContext: Checking redirects {user: true, pathname: '/profile', ...}
AuthContext: No redirect needed - user is on correct page
```

### ❌ Bad Messages (Still Has Issues):
```
AuthContext: Auth state change: SIGNED_IN ...
AuthContext: User signed in, redirecting to dashboard
```

## Debugging Steps

If you're still seeing redirects:

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12)
2. **Clear Console** (Ctrl+L)
3. **Reload Profile Page**
4. **Copy all console messages** and share them

### Key Things to Check:

1. **Is the user authenticated?** Look for `hasUser: true`
2. **What's the current pathname?** Should be `/profile`
3. **Are there multiple auth events?** Should only see one `SIGNED_IN` event
4. **Is the redirect check being skipped?** Look for "Skipping redirect check"

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ Profile Page Reload:
- User stays on `/profile`
- No redirect to dashboard
- Console shows "No redirect needed"

### ✅ Auth Page Access:
- Smooth redirect to dashboard
- No flashing
- Console shows "Redirecting authenticated user"

### ✅ Dashboard/Profile Access (Unauthenticated):
- Redirect to auth page
- Console shows "Redirecting unauthenticated user"

## If Issues Persist

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check the console messages** and share them
2. **Note the exact sequence** of events
3. **Try clearing browser cache** and cookies
4. **Test in incognito mode** to rule out cache issues

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Still redirecting on profile reload
**Solution**: Check if there are multiple `SIGNED_IN` events in console

### Issue: Auth page flashing
**Solution**: Check if redirect is happening multiple times

### Issue: Slow redirects
**Solution**: Check if loading states are working properly
